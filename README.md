# mod_exploit
modified versions of exploits

This is a repository for public exploits I have ported, modified or otherwise altered in a manner sufficiently significant to share in this repository.

121.c
  -ported from windows to unix C libraries

616.c
  -another port from windows to unix C libraries; this code will not exploit as is, it was edited it to prevent use
    --see commit notes for details

eternalblue.sh
eternalblue_doublepulsar2.rb
  -variations on launching the eternalblue exploit binary and doublepulsar implant to inject a dll containing malicious code into a target process
